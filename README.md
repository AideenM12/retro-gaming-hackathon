* Eat, Sleep, Hack, Repeat!





**The Ideal User of this site is :**
* Someone who enjoys gaming!
* Someone with a keen interest in building collaborative projects.
* Someone who enjoys the nostalgic feel of retro gaming!
* Someone with a keen interest in frontend development for interactive games/sites.

* As a first time user I want to play a game thematically inspired by retro games. 
* As a returning user I ...

# Structure

## Features

The website is divided into four separate pages. A home page, a tours page, a meet-ups page and a contact page. Each page has the same heading located on the left with navigation located on the right on the same row. Each page has the same footer with social media icon links on the right and the webpage title to the left. The same hero image is used on each page and located directly beneath the navigation bar. A row of navigation links are located directly below the hero image also. 

#### Home Page.

The home page gives a general overview of the content offered by the site. 

#### Main Menu
The main menu consists of a series of modals.
* The first modal is triggered when the user lands on the page. It provides the user with the option of viewing the game instructions or beginning the game immediately.

* The second modal is triggered when the user selects the "How to Play" button. This modal provides the user with a series of instructions on how to play the game. The user can then select the "Start Game" button.

* The third modal allows the user to select the gender of the character they would like to use. They are presented with two image buttons to choose from before beginning gameplay.

#### Credits page
* The Credits page showcases all the collaborators who worked together to make this project. Links to each individual collaborator's github page can be found on this page alongside a link to the main menu page. A link to the site repository can also be found on this page, many thanks to Andy for taking the time to work with [Materializecss](https://materializecss.com/) for the first time to create this page.

### Existing Features
* The title header is located on the left of every page. Its function is to build and promote brand awareness whilst also creating a positive emotional response from the user by showcasing the color-scheme and typography specifically chosen for the brand.

* The navigation bar is located to the left of the title header on every page. It is located where a user would expect to find it to promote ease of use and easy navigation. Bootstrap technology allows it to collapse into a hamburger style on mobile devices again to match the expectation of the user and also make efficient use of screen space on smaller screens.

* The hero image is located on the desktop version of each page. 


* The footer follows the same design as the header. The website title is located on the left and links to Facebook, Instagram and Github are stored in the icons to the right. Each of these links opens in a new tab so as to keep the user on the business page longer. 

### Out of Scope Features

* An original third modal was triggered when the user selects the "Start Game" button. This modal intended to allow the user to select their preferred mode of difficulty of gameplay. The user is presented with three options : Easy, Medium, Hard. This was deemed out of scope for this current project due to conflicts with the Phaser framework but will possibly be investigated at a later stage.

### Design

**Typography**
The 'MedievalSharp' font was chosen to match the medieval aesthetic of the game. It was found on google fonts.

**Colours**
The color palette was chosen using the https://coolors.co website. This particular palette was chosen for its simplicity and because the basic colours presented are redolent of those often found in retro PC games.

**Imagery**
The imagery used was primarily found on [unsplash](https://unsplash.com). These images were chosen because they matched the aesthetic and colour-scheme of the website whilst also providing an accurate representation of what was being offered. In the images Irish bars can be seen, as can drinks and also people socialising. The images of the testimonials section were provided by the developer to give the site a more authentic feel.
