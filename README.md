# Structure

## Features

The website is divided into four separate pages. A home page, a tours page, a meet-ups page and a contact page. Each page has the same heading located on the left with navigation located on the right on the same row. Each page has the same footer with social media icon links on the right and the webpage title to the left. The same hero image is used on each page and located directly beneath the navigation bar. A row of navigation links are located directly below the hero image also. 

#### Home Page.

The home page gives a general overview of the content offered by the site. 



 

### Existing Features
* The title header is located on the left of every page. Its function is to build and promote brand awareness whilst also creating a positive emotional response from the user by showcasing the color-scheme and typography specifically chosen for the brand.

* The navigation bar is located to the left of the title header on every page. It is located where a user would expect to find it to promote ease of use and easy navigation. Bootstrap technology allows it to collapse into a hamburger style on mobile devices again to match the expectation of the user and also make efficient use of screen space on smaller screens.

* The hero image is located on the desktop version of each page. 


* The footer follows the same design as the header. The website title is located on the left and links to Facebook, Instagram and Github are stored in the icons to the right. Each of these links opens in a new tab so as to keep the user on the business page longer. 



### Design

**Typography**
I chose the 'Special Elite' font because it me reminded of the fonts used on old-style beer labels which helps 
with the aesthetic I wanted to create. I contrasted this with the 'Zilla Slab' font in order to complement the 
'Special Elite' font and also to maintain some style neutrality in order to prevent a style overload on the website.

**Colours**
I chose my color palette using the https://coolors.co website which my mentor had recommended. I chose these colors because
I felt the palette best represented what the website offered, a friendly exploration of Galway's pub scene and night life.


<img src="documentation/milestone1-palette (640x480).jpg" width="450" height="250" alt="milestone palette">

* Oxford Blue - Hex: #000022 | RGB (0, 0, 34)
* Oxford Blue - Hex: #001242 | RGB (0, 18, 66)
* Lavender Blue - Hex: #C1D3FE | RGB (193, 211, 254)
* Blue NCS - Hex: #0094C6 | RGB (0, 148, 198)
* Blue Sapphire - Hex: #005E7C | RGB (0, 94, 124)
* Rich Black FOGRA 29 - Hex: #040F16 | RGB (4, 15, 22)

**Imagery**
The imagery used was primarily found on [unsplash](https://unsplash.com). These images were chosen because they matched the aesthetic and colour-scheme of the website whilst also providing an accurate representation of what was being offered. In the images Irish bars can be seen, as can drinks and also people socialising. The images of the testimonials section were provided by the developer to give the site a more authentic feel.

## Testing

### Testing User Stories



**Further Testing**

* All HTML passed through the prescribed [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) with no issues. Some warnings were given to add identifying headings to sections but this was addressed using the commented headings to divide the pages into easily readable sections.

The below image is an example result of lighthouse testing performed on the index page for mobile with every other test achieving similar results. The lighthouse tool found in Google Dev Tools was used repeatedly throughout the building of the project and was essential in discovering and resolving the issues described below. A lighthouse test was performed on both mobile and desktop for each individual page on the site with links to the full reports of each of these tests found below. The lighthouse tool tested each of the following criteria: performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of each individual page in both mobile and desktop. Each test resulted in a score of 85 or above for each of the aforementioned criteria.
